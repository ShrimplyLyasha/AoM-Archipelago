# =============================================================================
# Age of Mythology Retold — YAML Option Definitions
# =============================================================================
#
# Every player-facing option is defined here as an Archipelago `Choice`,
# `Range`, or `Toggle` subclass.  The `AomOptions` dataclass at the bottom
# binds each class to its YAML key — that is the single source of truth used
# by the Archipelago framework to parse YAMLs and by `aomWorld.options` at
# runtime.
#
# Lifecycle:
#   * The Archipelago website reads the option metadata (display_name,
#     internal_name, defaults, docstring) and renders the YAML template.
#   * At generation time the framework instantiates `AomOptions`, which
#     populates `self.options` on `aomWorld`.
#   * `aomWorld.generate_early()` (in __init__.py) reads `self.options.<x>.value`
#     to drive every world-shaping decision (excluded civs, disabled campaigns,
#     gem shop generation, etc.).  See the data-flow diagram in __init__.py.
#   * Many options are echoed into `fill_slot_data()` so the running game
#     client (client/ApClient.py + client/GameClient.py) can branch on them.
#
# Web display order is controlled by `aomWorld.web.option_groups` over in
# __init__.py — keep that list in sync when adding new options.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ADDING A NEW OPTION
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   1. Subclass `Choice`/`Range`/`Toggle` here with `internal_name`,
#      `display_name`, defaults, and a docstring (the docstring becomes the
#      tooltip / YAML comment shown to players).
#   2. Add a field on `AomOptions` whose attribute name matches
#      `internal_name`.
#   3. Import the class in __init__.py and (if user-facing) add it to a group
#      in `aomWorld.web.option_groups`.
#   4. Read the value in `generate_early()` (or wherever applies) via
#      `self.options.<name>.value`.
#   5. If the running game needs to know about the option, surface it from
#      `fill_slot_data()` and consume it in client/ApClient.py + GameClient.py
#      (XS emitter).
#
# Disabling civs / campaigns:
#   The `shuffle_<civ>_major_gods` toggles drive `excluded_civs`, and the
#   `<campaign>_campaign` toggles drive `disabled_campaigns`.  Items.py and
#   Locations.py honor these by skipping civ-tagged items and excluded
#   campaigns; Rules.py honors them by skipping rules for missing locations.

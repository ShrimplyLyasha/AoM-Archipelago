# =============================================================================
# Age of Mythology Retold — Item catalog
# =============================================================================
#
# The full set of items the AoMR randomizer can place into a multiworld.  Every
# item is declared as a member of the `aomItemData` IntEnum at the bottom of
# this file.  Each member carries:
#
#   * a numeric `id` (the AP item code, plus `BASE_ID` when serialized)
#   * a display `item_name`
#   * a `type` payload — one of the @dataclass classes defined above
#
# The `type`'s class is what `item_type_to_classification` keys on to decide
# `progression` / `useful` / `filler` / `trap`.
#
# Lifecycle:
#   * `aomWorld.create_items()` (in __init__.py) iterates `aomItemData`, applies
#     option-driven filters (campaign / civ / hero ability), and builds the
#     itempool.
#   * Locked-placement items (Victory, Gem, ProgressiveShopInfo) are placed by
#     `rules/Rules.py` instead of bucketed into the random pool.
#   * On the game side, each item id eventually maps to an XS handler in
#     `triggers/archipelago.xs` (see `APApplyItems` and the helper functions
#     it dispatches to).  GameClient.py emits the per-slot state that those
#     handlers consume.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CULTURE / CIV TAGGING
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Civ-specific items must carry a `culture` field on their payload dataclass
# (or a recognizable substring in `unit_name`) so `aomWorld.create_items()`'s
# civ-exclusion logic can drop the item when the player's YAML excludes that
# civilization.  Generic items (resources, traps, hero items shared across
# civs) never need this tag.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ID RANGES — keep new items inside an unused band to avoid silent IntEnum
# collisions.  Existing bands:
#     1-99      Starting Resources / Passive Income                (filler)
#     1002-1011 Progressive Age Unlocks                             (progression)
#     2000-3199 Hero stat / action / special ability boosts        (mostly useful)
#     3200-3299 Unit unlocks (Can Train Hoplite etc.)              (progression/useful)
#     3300-3499 Kastor specials/stats                               (mixed)
#     3500-3504 Campaign / section unlocks                          (progression)
#     3510      Atlantis Key                                        (progression)
#     4000-4099 StartingArmys                                      (filler/useful)
#     5000-5009 Villager carry / cost                               (filler)
#     5015-5027 Hero "Joins" + myth unit unlocks                    (useful/progression)
#     5100-5103 Starting tech grants                                (useful/filler)
#     9950-9995 Traps                                               (trap)
#     9997-9999 Special: ProgressiveShopInfo, Gem, Victory          (locked placements)
#
# When adding a new item, pick the next free id within the matching band — and
# remember `aomItemData` is an IntEnum, so two members with the same numeric
# value silently alias and the second one disappears.  See the KASTOR comment
# block for the exact bug we hit by reusing 3200-3209.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EXTENDING
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   * New civ-specific unit unlock: add a `UnitUnlockUseful(unit_name, culture)`
#     entry, then ensure XS code unforbids the unit when the item is received
#     (see APApplyItems' unit-unlock dispatch in archipelago.xs).
#   * New hero: define stat / special / action items with `hero=` set to the
#     scenario-editor proto unit name; XS already dispatches generically off
#     the hero name.
#   * New trap: add a Trap dataclass entry with the next `trap_type` int and
#     mirror the constant in ap_ai_runtime.xs (`cAPTrap*`).
#   * New campaign: add a `Campaign(campaign=...)` entry whose `vanilla_campaign`
#     points at the new `aomCampaignData` enum member.  Section-unlock semantics
#     (precollect when starting / progression otherwise) are inherited.
#   * New age-tier myth unlock: extend `MythUnitUnlockProgression`/`Useful`/`Filler`
#     with the new culture's unit list.  Match `culture` to civ string used
#     elsewhere ("Greek"/"Egyptian"/"Norse"/"Atlantean") so create_items filters
#     consistently.

# =============================================================================
# Age of Mythology Retold — Archipelago client (CLI + Tk GUI)
# =============================================================================
#
# Spawned by the Archipelago Launcher when the user clicks "Age Of Mythology
# Retold Client".  Connects to the AP server, exchanges items/locations, and
# bridges those events into the running game by writing XS state files into
# the player's AoMR user folder.
#
# Responsibilities:
#   * Authenticate to the AP server and load slot_data.
#   * Install the bundled XS trigger files (archipelago.xs, ap_init.xs,
#     ap_ai_*.xs) into the AoMR user folder so the game has them available.
#   * Maintain `user.cfg` so AI echo / trigger echo are enabled (we read
#     the AoMR log file to detect in-game events).
#   * Watch the AoMR log file for `APLocationCheck` markers emitted by the
#     game's XS triggers and forward them as AP location events.
#   * Receive items from the AP server, hand them to GameClient.py which
#     writes the per-game `aom_state.xs` (state file consumed by archipelago.xs).
#   * Surface a Tk-based status window via ApGui.py.
#
# Critical files & paths:
#   * `<user_folder>/trigger/archipelago.xs` and `ap_init.xs` — included from
#     each scenario.
#   * `<user_folder>/Game/AI/ap_ai_*.xs` — AI script referenced by every map.
#   * `<user_folder>/config/user.cfg` — must contain `aiDebug` and
#     `enableTriggerEcho` for the AP↔game bridge to work.
#   * `<user_folder>/Logs/<latest>.txt` — AoMR's stdout-equivalent.  We tail
#     this to detect game events.
#
# Slot data flow:
#   server -> on_package -> _load_slot_data -> self.game_ctx.<field>
#   The fields are then read by GameClient.py when emitting aom_state.xs.
#
# Adding a new server-to-game datum:
#   1. Emit it from `aomWorld.fill_slot_data` in __init__.py.
#   2. Read it in `_load_slot_data` here and store on `self.game_ctx`.
#   3. Reference it in GameClient.py XS emission and consume it in
#      archipelago.xs at runtime.
#
# Adding a new game-to-server event:
#   1. Make archipelago.xs print a unique token via trChatSend / aiEcho.
#   2. Add a regex pattern + handler in the log-watcher (search for
#      'APLocationCheck' / 'APStatus' to find existing patterns).
#   3. Implement the AP-side handling (typically calling
#      `await self.send_msgs([...])` to forward the event).
